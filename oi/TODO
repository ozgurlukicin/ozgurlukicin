- General 404 error pages (we can use get_object_or_404 function of django)
- File upload support in wysiwyg editor (tinymce)
- User management system (basic login/logout and user profiles)

- Move all view in apps/ dir. Now it is not flexible, when we want to add comment support on packages or news section in the future, it would be difficult..

 * apps/news
     | urls.py
     | views.py

 * apps/packages
     | urls.py
     | views.py

     it's great :)
