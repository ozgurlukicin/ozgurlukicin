    - On product info page, product's all childs are shown regardless of their active/deactive status. Fix this

[*] User
    - Don't forget to control user's bill information as bill class doesn't have any check.
    - Add javascript. It will be used to print out different bill form. E.g: When the user checks invidual bill,
            only adress form will be displayed. But when the user selects company bill, another form will be displayed.
            Additionally, user can have both bill type
