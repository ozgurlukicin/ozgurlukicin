[*] Category
    - Image with thumbnail support for each category
    - Show how many products a category have in the category tree. E.g: T-shirts (14)


[*] Product
    - Create Product class, damn?!
    - Make sure that product can have more than 1 picture. Also, these should be with thumbnail support

[*] User
    - Don't forget to control user's bill information as bill class doesn't have any check.
    - Add javascript. It will be used to print out different bill form. E.g: When the user checks invidual bill,
            only adress form will be displayed. But when the user selects company bill, another form will be displayed.
            Additionally, user can have both bill type

    - Add "mycart" to left
